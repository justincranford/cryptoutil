# Shared Telemetry Services for cryptoutil
# This compose file provides OpenTelemetry Collector and Grafana OTEL LGTM stack.
# Include this file from product-specific compose files using Docker Compose includes.
#
# Usage: Include this in your product compose.yml:
#   include:
#     - path: ../telemetry/compose.yml
#
services:
  # Healthcheck for OpenTelemetry Collector availability.
  # Ephemeral job that validates otel-collector is accepting connections before services start.
