# Shared Telemetry Services for cryptoutil
# This compose file provides OpenTelemetry Collector and Grafana OTEL LGTM stack.
# Include this file from product-specific compose files using Docker Compose includes.
#
# Usage: Include this in your product compose.yml:
#   include:
#     - path: ../telemetry/compose.yml

    # Example: cryptoutil services use "opentelemetry-collector-contrib:4317" internally
