# PRODUCT-level secrets (shared by all 5 identity services)
# See: docs/ARCHITECTURE-COMPOSE-MULTIDEPLOY.md Section 5.2 "Layered Pepper Strategy"
#
# When this PRODUCT compose file is used, the identity-hash_pepper.secret
# overrides SERVICE-level hash_pepper secrets for all 5 identity services.
#
# This enables shared SSO/federation within the identity product boundary.
