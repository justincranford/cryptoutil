# SUITE-level deployment - All 9 services across 5 products
# See: docs/ARCHITECTURE-COMPOSE-MULTIDEPLOY.md Section 4.3
#
# Usage: cd deployments/cryptoutil && docker compose up
#
# This compose file includes all PRODUCT-level compose files to deploy
# the complete cryptoutil suite (all 9 services).
#
# MANDATORY: Suite MUST delegate to PRODUCT-level, which delegates to SERVICE-level.
# This rigid delegation pattern (SUITE → PRODUCT → SERVICE) ensures scalability:
#   1) Products can scale from 1 to N services
#   2) Suite can scale from 5 to N products
#
# All includes reference PRODUCT-level compose files, which in turn include
# SERVICE-level compose files. Single-service products (sm, pki, cipher, jose)
# have PRODUCT-level compose files that include their single SERVICE.

include:
  # All products reference PRODUCT-level compose (rigid delegation)
  - path: ../sm/compose.yml         # sm product (kms service)
  - path: ../pki/compose.yml        # pki product (ca service)
  - path: ../cipher/compose.yml     # cipher product (im service)
  - path: ../jose/compose.yml       # jose product (ja service)
  - path: ../identity/compose.yml   # identity product (authz, idp, rp, rs, spa services)

# SUITE-level secrets (shared by ALL 9 services)
# See: docs/ARCHITECTURE-COMPOSE-MULTIDEPLOY.md Section 5.2 "Layered Pepper Strategy"
#
# When this SUITE compose file is used, the cryptoutil-hash_pepper.secret
# overrides PRODUCT and SERVICE level hash_pepper secrets via Docker Compose
# merging rules (parent > child).
#
# This enables cross-product SSO and unified identity federation.
