# Gremlins mutation testing configuration
# Documentation: https://gremlins.dev/

# Quality gates - make Gremlins fail if thresholds are not met
threshold-efficacy: 70.0    # Minimum percentage of killed mutants vs total killed+lived (reasonable target)
threshold-mcover: 60.0      # Minimum percentage of mutant coverage (focus on quality over quantity)

# Performance settings
workers: 2                  # Conservative worker count for stability
test-cpu: 1                 # Single CPU per test to avoid resource contention
timeout-coefficient: 3      # Higher timeout to avoid false timeouts

# Mutation operators (enable comprehensive coverage)
arithmetic-base: true       # Change +, -, *, /, % operators
conditionals-boundary: true # Change <, <=, >, >= boundaries (off-by-one errors)
conditionals-negation: true # Invert conditional expressions
increment-decrement: true   # Change ++, -- operators
invert-negatives: true      # Change positive/negative values

# Advanced mutation operators (can be noisy, start disabled)
invert-assignments: false   # Invert assignment operations
invert-bitwise: false       # Invert bitwise operations (&, |, ^)
invert-bwassign: false      # Invert bitwise assignment operations
invert-logical: false       # Invert logical operations (&&, ||)
invert-loopctrl: false      # Invert loop control (break/continue)
remove-self-assignments: false # Remove self-assignments like x = x
