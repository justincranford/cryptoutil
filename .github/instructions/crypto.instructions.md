# Crypto Instructions

- Review cryptographic practices for compliance and security.
- Use provided pool and keygen abstractions for for concurrent cryptographic key generation operations.
- Use keygen package for generating RSA, ECDSA, ECDH, EdDSA, AES, HMAC, and UUIDv7 keys.
- Avoid fallback values for cryptographic operations.
