# Continuous Work Directive

**CRITICAL: NEVER STOP UNTIL USER CLICKS "STOP" BUTTON**

## Core Principle

Work autonomously until problem completely solved. ONLY valid stop: user clicks STOP or ALL explicit tasks complete.

**When user provides task list**: Complete ALL tasks (e.g., "17 tasks" = complete all 17, not just current phase)

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 1.3 Core Principles](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#13-core-principles) for maximum quality strategy and continuous work requirements.

## Maximum Quality Strategy - MANDATORY

<!-- @source from="docs/ARCHITECTURE.md" as="quality-attributes" -->
**Quality Attributes (NO EXCEPTIONS)**:
- ✅ Correctness: ALL code functionally correct with comprehensive tests
- ✅ Completeness: NO phases or tasks or steps skipped, NO features de-prioritized, NO shortcuts
- ✅ Thoroughness: Evidence-based validation at every step
- ✅ Reliability: Quality gates enforced (≥95%/98% coverage/mutation)
- ✅ Efficiency: Optimized for maintainability and performance NOT implementation speed
- ✅ Accuracy: Changes must address root cause, not just symptoms
- ❌ Time Pressure: NEVER rush, NEVER skip validation, NEVER defer quality checks
- ❌ Premature Completion: NEVER mark phases or tasks or steps complete without objective evidence
<!-- @/source -->

**ALL issues are blockers**: Fix immediately. NEVER defer ("fix later"). NEVER skip validation.

**Continuous Execution**: Task complete -> Commit -> IMMEDIATELY start next task (zero pause, zero text to user).

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 1.3 Core Principles](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#13-core-principles) and [Section 11.2 Quality Gates](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#112-quality-gates) for quality attributes and enforcement.

---

## Prohibited Stop Behaviors

- Status summaries, "session complete" messages, "next steps" proposals
- Asking permission ("Should I continue?", "Shall I proceed?")
- Pauses between tasks, celebrations, premature completion claims
- Leaving uncommitted changes, stopping after analysis

**Pattern**: Work -> Commit -> Next tool invocation (ZERO text, ZERO questions)

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13. Development Practices](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#13-development-practices) for continuous execution patterns.

---

## Blocker Handling

Document blocker in tracking doc -> Switch to unblocked tasks -> Return when resolved. NEVER stop all work due to one blocker.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13. Development Practices](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#13-development-practices) for blocker handling and work discovery strategies.

## Work Discovery (No Active Tasks)

1. Check tracking docs -> 2. Quality improvements -> 3. TODOs (`grep -r "TODO\|FIXME"`) -> 4. Review commits -> 5. CI/CD health -> 6. Code quality -> 7. Performance -> 8. ONLY if nothing exists: Ask user

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13. Development Practices](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#13-development-practices) for work discovery and task management patterns.

## Infrastructure Blocker Escalation

<!-- @source from="docs/ARCHITECTURE.md" as="infrastructure-blocker-escalation" -->
**MANDATORY: ALL infrastructure issues are BLOCKING. NEVER defer, deprioritize, skip, or tag as "pre-existing."**

Three-encounter rule: 1st → document, 2nd → create fix task, 3rd → MANDATORY Phase 0 fix (block ALL other work). Infrastructure blockers (OTel, Docker, testcontainers, CI/CD) take priority over feature work.
<!-- @/source -->

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13.7 Infrastructure Blocker Escalation](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#137-infrastructure-blocker-escalation) for the three-encounter escalation rule and infrastructure categories.

## Quality Gates (Per Task)

**Before marking complete**: Build clean -> Linting clean -> Tests pass (100%, zero skips) -> Coverage maintained -> Mutation testing -> Evidence exists -> Git commit

See: evidence-based instructions, testing instructions, git instructions

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 11.2 Quality Gates](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#112-quality-gates) for comprehensive quality gate requirements and enforcement.

## Mandatory Review Passes

<!-- @source from="docs/ARCHITECTURE.md" as="mandatory-review-passes" -->
**MANDATORY: Minimum 3, maximum 5 review passes before marking any task complete.**

Copilot and AI agents have a tendency to partially fulfill requested work, accidentally omitting or skipping items per request. To counter this, every task completion MUST include at least 3 review passes, each checking ALL 8 quality attributes:

**Each pass checks ALL 8 attributes** (fresh perspective per pass):
1. ✅ **Correctness** — code/docs correct, no regressions
2. ✅ **Completeness** — all tasks/steps/items addressed, nothing skipped
3. ✅ **Thoroughness** — evidence-based validation, all edge cases covered
4. ✅ **Reliability** — build, lint, test, coverage, mutation all pass
5. ✅ **Efficiency** — optimized for maintainability, not implementation speed
6. ✅ **Accuracy** — root cause addressed, not just symptoms
7. ❌ **NO Time Pressure** — NEVER rushed, NEVER cutting corners
8. ❌ **NO Premature Completion** — objective evidence required before marking complete

**Continuation rule**: If pass 3 finds ANY issue, continue to pass 4. If pass 4 still finds issues, continue to pass 5. Diminishing returns = done.

**Scope**: ALL work types — code, docs, config, tests, infrastructure, deployments.
<!-- @/source -->

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 2.5 Quality Strategy](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#25-quality-strategy) for mandatory review pass requirements.

## Implementation Guidelines

- Read 2000+ lines for context before editing
- Make small, testable, incremental changes
- Root cause analysis: Use `get_errors`, debug thoroughly, add logging/tests as needed

**Context Gathering**: Use fetch_webpage for URLs, dependencies, third-party packages (knowledge is out of date)

**Rigor**: Plan before function calls, test thoroughly (edge cases, boundary conditions), verify all changes

**Resume/Continue**: Check conversation history for next incomplete step, continue autonomously

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13. Development Practices](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#13-development-practices) for implementation guidelines and code quality standards.
