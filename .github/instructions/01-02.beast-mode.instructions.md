# Continuous Work Directive

**CRITICAL: NEVER STOP UNTIL USER CLICKS "STOP" BUTTON**

## Core Principle

Work autonomously until problem completely solved. ONLY valid stop: user clicks STOP or ALL explicit tasks complete.

**When user provides task list**: Complete ALL tasks (e.g., "17 tasks" = complete all 17, not just current phase)

---

## Maximum Quality Strategy - MANDATORY

**Quality Attributes (NO EXCEPTIONS)**:
- Correctness: ALL code functionally correct with comprehensive tests
- Completeness: NO phases/tasks/steps skipped, NO shortcuts
- Thoroughness: Evidence-based validation at every step
- Reliability: Quality gates enforced (see testing instructions for coverage/mutation targets)
- Accuracy: Changes must address root cause, not just symptoms

**ALL issues are blockers**: Fix immediately. NEVER defer ("fix later"). NEVER skip validation.

**Continuous Execution**: Task complete -> Commit -> IMMEDIATELY start next task (zero pause, zero text to user).

---

## Prohibited Stop Behaviors

- Status summaries, "session complete" messages, "next steps" proposals
- Asking permission ("Should I continue?", "Shall I proceed?")
- Pauses between tasks, celebrations, premature completion claims
- Leaving uncommitted changes, stopping after analysis

**Pattern**: Work -> Commit -> Next tool invocation (ZERO text, ZERO questions)

---

## Blocker Handling

Document blocker in tracking doc -> Switch to unblocked tasks -> Return when resolved. NEVER stop all work due to one blocker.

## Work Discovery (No Active Tasks)

1. Check tracking docs -> 2. Quality improvements -> 3. TODOs (`grep -r "TODO\|FIXME"`) -> 4. Review commits -> 5. CI/CD health -> 6. Code quality -> 7. Performance -> 8. ONLY if nothing exists: Ask user

## Quality Gates (Per Task)

**Before marking complete**: Build clean -> Linting clean -> Tests pass (100%, zero skips) -> Coverage maintained -> Mutation testing -> Evidence exists -> Git commit

See: evidence-based instructions, testing instructions, git instructions

## Implementation Guidelines

- Read 2000+ lines for context before editing
- Make small, testable, incremental changes
- Root cause analysis: Use `get_errors`, debug thoroughly, add logging/tests as needed

**Context Gathering**: Use fetch_webpage for URLs, dependencies, third-party packages (knowledge is out of date)

**Rigor**: Plan before function calls, test thoroughly (edge cases, boundary conditions), verify all changes

**Resume/Continue**: Check conversation history for next incomplete step, continue autonomously
