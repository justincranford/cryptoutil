# Products & Services Architecture - CRITICAL

**cryptoutil** is a production-ready suite of four cryptographic-based services, designed with enterprise-grade security, **FIPS 140-3** standards compliance, Zero-Trust principles, and security-on-by-default.

## Product Suite Architecture - CRITICAL

Each product can be used independently, or together as a comprehensive security solution. The four services are:

1. **Key Management Service (KMS)** - One service. Elastic Keys per tenant support Encrypt/Decrypt or Sign/Verify (depending on algorithm). Each Elastic Key is a key ring of 1-N Material Keys of specified algorithm. Latest Material Key is always used for Encrypt||Sign, and historical Material Key is always used for Decrypt||Verify. Encrypt/Decrypt payload is JWE. Sign/Verify payload is JWS.
2. **Identity Service** - Five services. Authorization server supports OAuth 2.1 and OIDC 1.0. IdP server supports multi-factor authentication (e.g. Username/Password, mTLS, WebAuthn, Passkeys, TOTP, HOTP, Magic Link, Yubikey). Relying Party, Resource Server, and Single Page Application, are all security-on-by-default reference implementations for customers to use as the basis for their custom services.
3. **Certificate Authority (CA)** - One service. Collection of APIs/UI for Administration, CMP, CMPv2, SCEP, EST, RA, CRLDP, OSCP, TimeStamping
4. **JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)** - One service. Collection of APIs/UI for Administration, JWK, JWKSet, JWE, JWS, JWT

Examples of using multiple services together:
- KMS with CA+Identity+JOSE: KMS Product uses CA Product for TLS, Identity Product for authentication and authorization, and JOSE Product for API-based Encrypt/Decrypt JWE operations and Sign/Verify JWS operations.
- CA with Identity+JOSE: CA Product uses Identity Product for authentication and authorization, and JOSE Product for internal-based Encrypt/Decrypt JWE operations and Sign/Verify JWS operations.
- Identity with JOSE: Identity Product uses internal-based Encrypt/Decrypt JWE operations and Sign/Verify JWS operations.

## Microservices Architecture - CRITICAL

**MANDATORY: All Services in All Four Products MUST support Dual HTTPS**

- **HTTPS ONLY** - All Services MUST use TLS 1.3 by default; never use HTTP
- **HTTPS Certificates** - All Services MUST support configurable dynamic or static TLS server cert chains and private key:
  - Dynamic TLS server cert chain; leaf cert, intermediate CA certs, and root CA cert all auto-generated by a private CA scoped to per-Product or per-Suite.
  - Static TLS server cert cain; Docker Secrets for Private Keys, and Public File Paths or Public PEM data for TLS Server cert chain and Trusted CA certs
- **Private HTTPS Endpoint**: All Services MUST support configurable dynamic or static HTTPS port for administration-only
  - Default is 0 (dynamic port), can be set to a static port like 9090+
  - /admin/v1/** prefix for all endpoints: `/admin/v1/livez`, `/admin/v1/readyz`, `/admin/v1/healthz`, `/admin/v1/shutdown`
  - Not externally accessible; IPv4 127.0.0.1 only, never IPv6, never localhost
  - Used by Docker health checks, Kubernetes probes, monitoring, testing
- **Public HTTPS Endpoint**: All Services MUST support configurable dynamic or static HTTPS port for clients and users, but different prefixes and middlewares for browser-based vs non-browser-based clients
  - Default is 0 (dynamic port), can be set to a static port like 8080+
  - /service/** prefix for non-browser clients: Access token (HTTP Authorization header) enforces /service/ path prefix, and uses non-browser client middlewares (e.g. IP Allowlist, Rate Limiting)
  - /browser/** prefix for browser-based clients: Session token (HTTP Cookie header) enforces /browser/ path prefix, and browser-based client middleware (e.g. CSRF, CORS, CSP, IP Allowlist, Rate Limiting, etc)
  - /service/** access tokens must be obtained via OAuth 2.0 Client Authorization Flow; these are HTTP Authorization header bear tokens
  - /browser/** access tokens must be obtained via OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code + PKCE flow; these are HTTP Cookie header session tokens
  - /browser/** and /service/** must service the same APIs via a shared OpenAPI spec for API consistency, but under two different request paths with mutually exclusive access and middlewares
  - /browser/** must also service UI-only requests via HTML pages, JavaScript, CSS, images, fonts, etc
- **Example Dual Ports for Services**:
  - KMS:            Public HTTPS APIs/UI :8080 (0.0.0.0:8080 in container), Private HTTPS APIs (127.0.0.1:9090 in container)
  - Identity AuthZ: Public HTTPS APIs/UI :8180 (0.0.0.0:8080 in container), Private HTTPS APIs (127.0.0.1:9090 in container)
  - Identity IdP:   Public HTTPS APIs/UI :8181 (0.0.0.0:8080 in container), Private HTTPS APIs (127.0.0.1:9090 in container)
  - Identity RS:    Public HTTPS APIs/UI :8182 (0.0.0.0:8080 in container), Private HTTPS APIs (127.0.0.1:9090 in container)
  - Identity RP:    Public HTTPS APIs/UI :8183 (0.0.0.0:8080 in container), Private HTTPS APIs (127.0.0.1:9090 in container)
  - Identity SPA:   Public HTTPS APIs/UI :8184 (0.0.0.0:8080 in container), Private HTTPS APIs (127.0.0.1:9090 in container)
  - JOSE:           Public HTTPS APIs/UI :8280 (0.0.0.0:8080 in container), Private HTTPS APIs (127.0.0.1:9090 in container)
  - CA:             Public HTTPS APIs/UI :8380 (0.0.0.0:8080 in container), Private HTTPS APIs (127.0.0.1:9090 in container)
