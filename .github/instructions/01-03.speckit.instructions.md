# Speckit Workflow Integration - CRITICAL

See detailed Speckit patterns in: `06-02.speckit-detailed.instructions.md`

## Quick Reference

- **Living Documents**: Constitution/spec/plan evolve through implementation (not static)
- **Evidence-Based Completion**: Never mark tasks complete without objective proof
- **Continuous Feedback**: Update constitution/spec/clarify immediately during implementation
- **DETAILED.md Section 2**: Append-only timeline is authoritative implementation log
- **Mini-cycle feedback**: Update specs every 2-3 tasks, not end of phase

## Cross-References

- Evidence requirements: See `06-01.evidence-based.instructions.md`
- Workflow integration details: See `06-02.speckit-detailed.instructions.md`
