# SpecKit

**This file contains ONLY tactical implementation patterns**

SpecKit is a spec-driven development toolset for LLM Agents to autonomously implement designs.

**Seven Steps**: 1. Constitution, 2. Clarify (optional), 3. Spec, 4. Plan, 5. Tasks, 6. Analyze (optional), 7. Implement

**When to Use**:

- ✅ Design before implementing code
- ✅ Catch design issues early
- ✅ Direct LLM Agents to converge on working implementations
- ✅ Straight-line or spiral workflows

**When NOT to Use**:

- ❌ Human SDLC (lacks iterative feedback loops)
- ❌ Validating implementation, business domain rules, complex state transitions
- ❌ Spiking or quick iteration (feels heavy, slow, overly restrictive)

## Customizations

### Living Documents Pattern

Treat constitution, spec, and plan as evolving through implementation feedback - NOT static prerequisites.

**MANDATORY**: Update immediately when discovering constraints, contradictions, insights.

### Clarify and Analyze as MANDATORY

**Original**: Clarify and Analyze steps are optional
**Customization**: Treat both as MANDATORY

**Rationale**: Clarify identifies and fixes issues in constitution and spec before proceeding to plan.

### CLARIFY-QUIZME-##.md Format

**MANDATORY**: CLARIFY-QUIZME-##.md MUST only contain UNKNOWN answers requiring user input.

**Format**: Multiple choice questions with insightful A-D answers and blank E write-in answer.

**NEVER include**:

- ❌ Questions with answers from codebase/constitution/spec/copilot instructions
- ❌ Pre-filled answers or example answers in Write-in questions

**ALWAYS**:

- ✅ Search codebase/docs before adding questions to CLARIFY-QUIZME-##.md
- ✅ Merge CLARIFY-QUIZME-##.md answers into clarify.md, refactor structure/content to accommodate
- ✅ Use updated clarify.md to backport clarifications into constitution.md and spec.md
- ✅ Re-analyze constitution.md, spec.md, clarify.md, generate another CLARIFY-QUIZME-##.md automatically
- ✅ Prompt user to review CLARIFY-QUIZME-##.md if new questions, or automatically run /specify.plan and notify user

## Workflow Gates - MANDATORY

| Gate | Evidence Required | Validation |
|------|-------------------|------------|
| **Constitution** | No TBD placeholders, terminology defined, quality gates, alignment with copilot instructions without conflicts | `grep -i "TBD\|TODO\|FIXME" constitution.md` = 0 |
| **Specification** | Functional/non-functional requirements, architecture, API contracts, services overview, databases overview, security requirements | Verify all constitution requirements mapped |
| **Clarification** | Topical organization, clarify.md for knowns, CLARIFY-QUIZME-##.md for unknowns | Verify no pending questions |
| **Plan** | Phases with task breakdowns, task dependencies, completion criteria per phase, risk assessment, aligns with constitution/spec/copilot | Compare plan vs constitution/spec/clarify |
| **Tasks** | Task checklist, completion criteria per task, phase assignments, dependencies, effort estimates (S/M/L) | Verify tasks.md matches plan.md phases |
| **Analysis** | Complexity analysis, risk assessment, dependency graph, resource requirements (optional) | Verify analyze.md exists if needed |
| **Implementation** | Track in DETAILED.md Sections 1+2, EXECUTIVE.md, issues found, risks discovered, lessons learned, progress evidence (tests pass, coverage ≥95%/98%, mutation ≥85%/98%, timing <15s/<120s unit, <45s/<240s E2E) | `go test ./... -coverprofile`, `gremlins unleash` |

## Evidence-Based Completion - MANDATORY

**NEVER mark tasks complete during Implementation without objective evidence**:

### Code Evidence

- `go build ./...` clean
- `golangci-lint run` clean
- No new TODOs
- Coverage ≥95% (production code) or ≥98% (infrastructure/utility code)

### Test Evidence

- `go test ./...` passes
- No skips without tracking
- Coverage reports generated

### Mutation Evidence

- `gremlins unleash` passes
- Quality analysis shows ≥85% during early phases
- Quality gate jumps to ≥98% during later phases

### Git Evidence

- Conventional commit format
- Clean working tree
- Changes align with task

### Git Hooks Evidence

- Pre-commit checks pass
- Pre-push checks pass

## Feedback Loop Patterns - MANDATORY

**When discovering constraints/contradictions/lessons during Implementation**:

1. Document in DETAILED.md Section 2 timeline, mark as needing user review for copilot anti-patterns instructions
2. Document in EXECUTIVE.md, mark as needing user review for copilot anti-patterns instructions
3. Update constitution/spec/clarify immediately
4. Commit with traceable reference to source

**CRITICAL**: DON'T PROMPT THE USER TO REVIEW DETAILED.md and EXECUTIVE.md. The user already implicitly knows to asynchronously review DETAILED.md and EXECUTIVE.md.

## DETAILED.md Structure

### Section 1: Task Checklist

Maintain from tasks.md with:

- Status: ❌ (not started), ⚠️ (in progress/blocked), ✅ (complete)
- Blockers
- Notes
- Coverage metrics
- Commit references

### Section 2: Append-Only Timeline

Chronological entries with:

- **Date**: Task description
- **Work completed**: Summary of implementation
- **Coverage/quality metrics**: Before/after numbers
- **Lessons learned**: Insights discovered
- **Constraints discovered**: Add to constitution.md
- **Requirements discovered**: Add to spec.md
- **Related commits**: Git commit hashes

## EXECUTIVE.md Structure

### Stakeholder Overview

- Current phase
- Progress percentage
- Coverage metrics
- Mutation score
- Blockers

### Customer Demonstrability

- Docker Compose commands
- E2E demo scenarios
- Video demonstrations (optional)

### Risk Tracking

- Known issues with severity
- Impact assessment
- Workarounds
- Root cause analysis
- Resolution plan
- Status

### Post-Mortem Lessons

- Lesson learned
- Prevention pattern
- Where applied
- Reference documentation

## Quick Implementation Checklist

**Before Starting Implementation**:

- ✅ Constitution: No TBD/TODO/FIXME (`grep -i "TBD\|TODO\|FIXME" constitution.md` = 0)
- ✅ Clarify: All QUIZME questions answered, merged into clarify.md
- ✅ Plan: Phases, tasks, dependencies, completion criteria defined

**During Implementation**:

- ✅ Evidence-based completion: Tests pass, coverage ≥95%/98%, mutations ≥85%/98%
- ✅ Update DETAILED.md Section 2 timeline chronologically
- ✅ Update constitution/spec/clarify when discovering new constraints
- ✅ Commit with conventional format, traceable references

**Completion Criteria**:

- ✅ `go build ./...` clean
- ✅ `golangci-lint run` clean
- ✅ `go test ./...` passes (no skips without tracking)
- ✅ Coverage ≥95% production, ≥98% infrastructure/utility
- ✅ `gremlins unleash` passes (≥85% early phases, ≥98% later phases)
- ✅ Git hooks pass (pre-commit, pre-push)

## Key Tactical Patterns

**Living Documents**: Update constitution/spec/clarify immediately when discovering constraints/contradictions
**Async Review**: User reviews DETAILED.md/EXECUTIVE.md asynchronously (don't prompt)
**QUIZME Format**: Multiple choice questions (A-D options + E write-in), ONLY unknowns requiring user input
