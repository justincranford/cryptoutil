# SpecKit Workflow - Tactical Guidance

**Reference**: See `.specify/memory/speckit.md` for complete specifications (7 steps, workflow gates, evidence requirements, DETAILED.md/EXECUTIVE.md structures)

**This file contains ONLY tactical implementation patterns**

## Quick Implementation Checklist

**Before Starting Implementation**:
- ✅ Constitution: No TBD/TODO/FIXME (`grep -i "TBD\|TODO\|FIXME" constitution.md` = 0)
- ✅ Clarify: All QUIZME questions answered, merged into clarify.md
- ✅ Plan: Phases, tasks, dependencies, completion criteria defined

**During Implementation**:
- ✅ Evidence-based completion: Tests pass, coverage ≥95%/98%, mutations ≥85%/98%
- ✅ Update DETAILED.md Section 2 timeline chronologically
- ✅ Update constitution/spec/clarify when discovering new constraints
- ✅ Commit with conventional format, traceable references

**Completion Criteria**:
- ✅ `go build ./...` clean
- ✅ `golangci-lint run` clean
- ✅ `go test ./...` passes (no skips without tracking)
- ✅ Coverage ≥95% production, ≥98% infrastructure/utility
- ✅ `gremlins unleash` passes (≥85% early phases, ≥98% later phases)
- ✅ Git hooks pass (pre-commit, pre-push)

## Key Tactical Patterns

**Living Documents**: Update constitution/spec/clarify immediately when discovering constraints/contradictions
**Async Review**: User reviews DETAILED.md/EXECUTIVE.md asynchronously (don't prompt)
**QUIZME Format**: Multiple choice questions (A-D options + E write-in), ONLY unknowns requiring user input
