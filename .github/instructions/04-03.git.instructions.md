# Git and Documentation Instructions

## Git Workflow

### Commit and Push Strategy
- **Commit vs Push**: Commit frequently for logical units of work; push only when ready for CI/CD and peer review
- **Pre-push hooks**: Run automatically before push to enforce quality gates (dependency checks, linting)
- **Dependency management**: Update dependencies incrementally with test validation between updates
- **Branch strategy**: Use feature branches for development; merge to main only after CI passes
- **Commit hygiene**: Keep commits atomic and focused; use conventional commit messages
- **Push readiness**: Ensure all pre-commit checks pass before pushing; resolve any hook failures

### Conventional Commits
- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) spec
- Format: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert
- Use imperative mood, lowercase, no period at end
- For breaking changes: add `!` after type or use `BREAKING CHANGE:`
- Keep subject 72 chars; explain what/why in body if needed

## Terminal Command Auto-Approval

### Pattern Checking Workflow
When executing terminal commands through Copilot:
1. **Check Pattern Match**: Verify if command matches `chat.tools.terminal.autoApprove` patterns in `.vscode/settings.json`
2. **Track Unmatched**: Maintain list of unmatched commands during session
3. **End-of-Session Review**: Ask user if they'd like to add new auto-approve patterns
4. **Pattern Recommendations**:
   - **Auto-Enable (true)**: Safe, informational, build commands
   - **Auto-Disable (false)**: Destructive, dangerous, system-altering commands

### Auto-Enable Candidates
- Read-only operations (status, list, inspect, logs, history)
- Build and test commands (build, test, format, lint)
- Safe informational commands (version, info, df)
- Development workflow commands (fetch, status, diff)

### Auto-Disable Candidates
- Destructive operations (rm, delete, prune, reset, kill)
- Network operations (push, pull from remotes)
- System modifications (install, update, edit configurations)
- File system changes (create, update, delete files/directories)
- Container execution (exec, run interactive containers)

### Pattern Format
- Use established regex: `"/^command (sub1|sub2)/": true|false`
- Group related subcommands with alternation `(cmd1|cmd2|cmd3)`
- Use `^` for start anchor and appropriate word boundaries
- Include comments explaining security rationale

## Pull Request Descriptions

### Title
- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Keep under 72 characters
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore

### Sections
- ** What**: Clear description of what PR does (present tense)
- ** Why**: Business/technical rationale, impact on users/system
- ** How**: High-level implementation approach, key decisions
- ** Testing**: How tested, coverage impact, manual steps
- ** Breaking Changes**: Migration guidance, API changes
- ** Documentation**: README changes, migration guides

### Code Review Checklist
- ** Security**: No sensitive data exposure, proper validation, secure defaults
- ** Quality**: Tests added/updated, linting passes, docs updated
- ** Performance**: No regressions, memory leaks addressed
- ** Operations**: Logging appropriate, monitoring/metrics added

### PR Size Guidelines
- ** Small (<200 lines)**: Single focused change, low risk
- ** Medium (200-500 lines)**: Multiple related changes, moderate risk
- ** Large (500+ lines)**: Complex feature, high risk, consider splitting
- ** Epic**: Break down into smaller, independently deployable PRs

## Core Documentation Organization

- Keep docs in 2 main files: `README.md` (main), `docs/README.md` (deep dive)
- **ALWAYS add to existing README.md** instead of creating new markdown files
- **NEVER create separate documentation files** for scripts or tools
- See README for content distribution and organization

## TO DO Docs Organization and Continuous Update

### Critical Requirements
- Keep 1-6 `./docs/todos-*.md` files for tracking missing or incomplete items before ending sessions
- Review `./docs/todos-*.md` files for completed items before ending sessions, and remove completed items
- **Delete completed tasks immediately** - don't mark as done, remove from file
- Always ensure files contain ONLY active, actionable tasks

### Implementation Guidelines
- **Large cleanups**: Use create_file to rewrite entire file with only active tasks
- **Failed replacements**: Create clean version in new file, then replace original
- **Avoid complex replace_string_in_file**: Large text blocks often fail due to whitespace mismatches
