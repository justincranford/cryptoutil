# Evidence Based

# Evidence-Based Task Completion - Tactical Guidance

## CRITICAL: Evidence Required for Completion Claims

**NEVER mark phases or tasks or steps complete without objective evidence**

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 2.4 Implementation Strategy](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#24-implementation-strategy) and [Section 11.2 Quality Gates](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#112-quality-gates) for evidence-based completion requirements and quality gate enforcement.

## Mandatory Evidence

**Code**: `go build ./...` clean, `go build -tags e2e,integration ./...` clean, `golangci-lint run` clean, `golangci-lint run --build-tags e2e,integration` clean, no new TODOs
**Tests**: `runTests` passes, no skips without tracking
**Git**: Conventional commits, clean working tree

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 11.2.1 MANDATORY Pre-Commit Quality Gates](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#1121-mandatory-pre-commit-quality-gates) for mandatory evidence requirements before marking work complete.

## Progressive Validation (After Every Task)

1. **TODO Scan**: `grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" <pkg>` = 0 new
2. **Test Run**: All tests passing
3. **Coverage**: Maintained/improved
4. **Mutation**: >=80% gremlins score per package
5. **Integration**: Core E2E works

**Quality Gate**: Task NOT complete until all checks pass

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 11.2 Quality Gates](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#112-quality-gates) and [Section 2.4 Implementation Strategy](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#24-implementation-strategy) for progressive validation workflow and completion verification checklist.

## Post-Mortem Enforcement

Every gap -> Immediate fix OR new task doc (`##.##-GAP_NAME.md`)

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13. Development Practices](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#13-development-practices) for post-mortem patterns and continuous improvement workflow.

## Coverage Ceiling Exceptions

When a package structurally cannot reach the mandatory coverage minimum, document a **coverage ceiling analysis** per [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 10.2.3](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#1023-coverage-targets). Package-level exceptions require: categorized uncovered lines, calculated ceiling, and per-phase documentation.

## Infrastructure Blocker Escalation

**MANDATORY: Infrastructure issues are ALWAYS blocking.** NEVER defer, deprioritize, or tag as "pre-existing."

Three-encounter escalation: 1st → document, 2nd → create fix task, 3rd → MANDATORY Phase 0 fix blocking ALL other work.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13.7 Infrastructure Blocker Escalation](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#137-infrastructure-blocker-escalation) for escalation rule details.

## Common Violations

- NEVER mark complete without validation, skip post-mortem
- ALWAYS run all checks, create post-mortems
- NEVER defer infrastructure blockers as "pre-existing" or "not our changes"

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 11.2 Quality Gates](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#112-quality-gates) and [Section 2.5 Quality Strategy](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#25-quality-strategy) for quality gate violations and enforcement patterns.
