# Evidence Based

# Evidence-Based Task Completion - Tactical Guidance

## CRITICAL: Evidence Required for Completion Claims

**NEVER mark phases or tasks or steps complete without objective evidence**

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 2.4 Implementation Strategy](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#24-implementation-strategy) and [Section 11.2 Quality Gates](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#112-quality-gates) for evidence-based completion requirements and quality gate enforcement.

## Mandatory Evidence

**Code**: `go build ./...` clean, `go build -tags e2e,integration ./...` clean, `golangci-lint run` clean, `golangci-lint run --build-tags e2e,integration` clean, no new TODOs
**Tests**: `runTests` passes, no skips without tracking
**Git**: Conventional commits, clean working tree

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 11.2.1 MANDATORY Pre-Commit Quality Gates](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#1121-mandatory-pre-commit-quality-gates) for mandatory evidence requirements before marking work complete.

## Progressive Validation (After Every Task)

1. **TODO Scan**: `grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" <pkg>` = 0 new
2. **Test Run**: All tests passing
3. **Coverage**: Maintained/improved
4. **Mutation**: >=80% gremlins score per package
5. **Integration**: Core E2E works

**Quality Gate**: Task NOT complete until all checks pass

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 11.2 Quality Gates](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#112-quality-gates) and [Section 2.4 Implementation Strategy](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#24-implementation-strategy) for progressive validation workflow and completion verification checklist.

## Post-Mortem Enforcement

Every gap -> Immediate fix OR new task doc (`##.##-GAP_NAME.md`)

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13. Development Practices](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#13-development-practices) for post-mortem patterns and continuous improvement workflow.

## Coverage Ceiling Exceptions

When a package structurally cannot reach the mandatory coverage minimum, document a **coverage ceiling analysis** per [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 10.2.3](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#1023-coverage-targets). Package-level exceptions require: categorized uncovered lines, calculated ceiling, and per-phase documentation.

## Infrastructure Blocker Escalation

<!-- @source from="docs/ARCHITECTURE.md" as="infrastructure-blocker-escalation" -->
**MANDATORY: ALL infrastructure issues are BLOCKING. NEVER defer, deprioritize, skip, or tag as "pre-existing."**

Three-encounter rule: 1st → document, 2nd → create fix task, 3rd → MANDATORY Phase 0 fix (block ALL other work). Infrastructure blockers (OTel, Docker, testcontainers, CI/CD) take priority over feature work.
<!-- @/source -->

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13.7 Infrastructure Blocker Escalation](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#137-infrastructure-blocker-escalation) for escalation rule details.

## Common Violations

- NEVER mark complete without validation, skip post-mortem
- ALWAYS run all checks, create post-mortems
- NEVER defer infrastructure blockers as "pre-existing" or "not our changes"

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 11.2 Quality Gates](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#112-quality-gates) and [Section 2.5 Quality Strategy](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#25-quality-strategy) for quality gate violations and enforcement patterns.

## Operational Excellence Cross-References

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 14.2 Incident Management](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#142-incident-management) for post-mortem templates, severity levels, and response time targets.

## Mandatory Review Passes

<!-- @source from="docs/ARCHITECTURE.md" as="mandatory-review-passes" -->
**MANDATORY: Minimum 3, maximum 5 review passes before marking any task complete.**

Copilot and AI agents have a tendency to partially fulfill requested work, accidentally omitting or skipping items per request. To counter this, every task completion MUST include at least 3 review passes, each checking ALL 8 quality attributes:

**Each pass checks ALL 8 attributes** (fresh perspective per pass):
1. ✅ **Correctness** — code/docs correct, no regressions
2. ✅ **Completeness** — all tasks/steps/items addressed, nothing skipped
3. ✅ **Thoroughness** — evidence-based validation, all edge cases covered
4. ✅ **Reliability** — build, lint, test, coverage, mutation all pass
5. ✅ **Efficiency** — optimized for maintainability, not implementation speed
6. ✅ **Accuracy** — root cause addressed, not just symptoms
7. ❌ **NO Time Pressure** — NEVER rushed, NEVER cutting corners
8. ❌ **NO Premature Completion** — objective evidence required before marking complete

**Continuation rule**: If pass 3 finds ANY issue, continue to pass 4. If pass 4 still finds issues, continue to pass 5. Diminishing returns = done.

**Scope**: ALL work types — code, docs, config, tests, infrastructure, deployments.
<!-- @/source -->

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 2.5 Quality Strategy](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#25-quality-strategy) for mandatory review pass requirements.
