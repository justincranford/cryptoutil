# TODO List Maintenance Instructions

- If a TODO/task list file (e.g., dast-todos.md) contains a maintenance guideline requiring deletion of completed or obsolete tasks, you MUST immediately remove those tasks from the file as soon as they are finished.
- Do NOT leave completed, obsolete, or irrelevant tasks in actionable listsâ€”this is mandatory for all TODO/task files with such a guideline.
- Always review the file for completed items before ending a session or marking work complete.
- This rule applies regardless of session history or context.
- Historical context should be kept in commit messages or durable documentation, not in actionable TODO lists.
