# Testing Instructions

- Run `go test ./... -cover` for automated tests
- Use testify require methods for assertions
- Use manual tests via Swagger UI (see README)
- Ensure coverage for all key types and pool configs
- Update/fix tests and run linters before committing (`golangci-lint run`)
- Script testing: always test scripts after add/update tests, verify help/params, test functional/error/cross-platform paths, document results (see README for details)
- Test directories may contain non-Go performance testing tools (e.g., Java Gatling in `/test/gatling/`)
- Use constants for repeated test values if it improves clarity; prefer meaningful test data
- When updating dependencies: run `go test ./...` first to confirm code and tests work before attempting updates; only after tests pass, update one dependency at a time and repeat `go test ./...` to iterate on fixing any issues caused by the update

## Test Structure Best Practices

- **ALWAYS use parameterized table-driven tests** for both happy path and sad path scenarios - they are clearer, more compact, and represent Go testing best practices
- **ALWAYS run tests after writing/modifying them** to verify correctness and catch issues early
- **ALWAYS analyze existing and new tests** for optimization opportunities: faster execution, better coverage, higher quality assertions
- **Target test coverage**: Maintain 80% or higher coverage for production code; 95% or higher for critical infrastructure code (e.g., cicd utilities)
- **Parameterized test benefits**: Easier to add new test cases, clearer test intent, reduced code duplication, better failure reporting

## Dependency Management Best Practices

- **Automated Checks**: Use `go-update-direct-dependencies` in pre-commit hooks and CI/CD workflows for efficient, focused dependency updates
- **Avoid**: `go-update-all-dependencies` in automated contexts as it can cause unnecessary updates and potential compatibility issues
- **Manual Updates**: Use `go-update-all-dependencies` only for intentional comprehensive dependency refreshes during major version updates or maintenance windows

## Test File Organization

Follow Go testing file naming conventions for proper organization:

| Test Type | File Suffix | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| Unit Tests | `_test.go` | Blackbox/whitebox testing of functions | `calculator_test.go` |
| Benchmarks | `_bench_test.go` | Performance testing | `calculator_bench_test.go` |
| Fuzz Tests | `_fuzz_test.go` | Property-based testing | `calculator_fuzz_test.go` |
| Integration | `_integration_test.go` | Component interaction testing | `api_integration_test.go` |
| E2E | `*_test.go` with `//go:build e2e` | Full system end-to-end testing | `e2e_test.go` |

**File Separation Rules:**
- Keep unit tests, benchmarks, and fuzz tests in separate files
- Use descriptive names that indicate the test focus
- Group related tests by functionality within each file type

## Fuzz Testing Guidelines

### CRITICAL: Unique Fuzz Test Naming Convention
- **ALL Fuzz* test function names MUST be unique and MUST NOT be substrings of any other fuzz test names**
- This ensures cross-platform compatibility without quotes or regex in `-fuzz` parameters
- **Example Problem**: `FuzzHKDF` conflicts with `FuzzHKDFwithSHA256` (substring match)
- **Solution**: Use `FuzzHKDFAllVariants` instead of `FuzzHKDF`
- **Why**: Go's `-fuzz` parameter does partial matching; unique names eliminate ambiguity
- **Cross-Platform**: Unquoted parameters work identically on Windows and Linux: `go test -fuzz=FuzzXXX`

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **NEVER do this**: Running fuzz tests from subdirectories (breaks Go module detection, causes "go.mod file not found" errors)
- **ALWAYS run Go fuzz tests from project root** - never use `cd` commands before `go test -fuzz` (causes module detection failures)
- **NEVER do this**: Using quotes or regex when test names are unique: `-fuzz="^FuzzXXX$"` (causes cross-platform issues)
- **NEVER do this**: Creating fuzz test names that are substrings of other fuzz test names

### Correct Fuzz Test Execution
- **ALWAYS do this**: Run from project root: `go test -fuzz=FuzzSpecificTest -fuzztime=5s ./internal/common/crypto/keygen`
- **ALWAYS do this**: Specify full package paths: `./internal/common/crypto/digests`
- **ALWAYS do this**: Use PowerShell `;` for chaining: `go test -fuzz=FuzzXXX -fuzztime=5s ./path; echo "Done"`
- **ALWAYS do this**: Use unquoted, unique test names: `-fuzz=FuzzGenerateRSAKeyPair` (no quotes needed)

### Fuzz Test Patterns
- **Specific fuzz test**: `go test -fuzz=FuzzXXX -fuzztime=15s ./<package>` (most common, no quotes)
- **All fuzz tests in package**: `go test -fuzz=. -fuzztime=15s ./<package>` (only if package has 1 fuzz test)
- **Quick verification**: Use `-fuzztime=15s` for fast feedback during development
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Avoid quotes and regex; ensure unique test names instead

## Test Concurrency and Robustness

- When creating test names, test code, test utilities, and test data (e.g. unique database names), ensure they are concurrency safe for parallel testing; use UUIDv7 suffixes for uniqueness, instead of counters or timestamps which can reset or collide during parallel execution
- UUIDv7 provides time-ordered uniqueness and randomness, making it ideal for concurrent testing while maintaining deterministic ordering for debugging
- Design tests, utilities, and data for robustness: avoid brittleness and brittle patterns that could cause intermittent failures

## Copilot Testing Guidelines

When testing linting of code samples or validating regex patterns during chat sessions:

- **Create permanent tests in `internal/cmd/cicd/cicd_test.go`** instead of one-off temporary test files
- This ensures test coverage persists across chat sessions and serves as regression testing
- Examples: regex validation tests, linting pattern tests, code transformation tests
- All tests in `cicd_test.go` execute automatically during Go test runs
- Use descriptive test names that indicate the validation purpose (e.g., `TestEnforceTestPatterns_RegexValidation`)

### cicd Utility Testing Patterns

When updating the cicd utility (`internal/cmd/cicd/cicd.go`):

- **Always implement programmatic tests** in `internal/cmd/cicd/cicd_test.go`
- **Test pattern**: Tests write generated code to temporary file (use `t.TempDir()`), run lint/check function against it, assert results programmatically
- **Avoid interactive prompts**: This prevents unwanted prompts during Copilot-assisted sessions
- **Avoid ephemeral shell commands**: Don't use piping PowerShell Get-Content replace commands - prefer programmatic edits via tests or scripted tools
- **Rationale**: Ephemeral shell patterns trigger unwanted prompts and premium LLM watch requests
