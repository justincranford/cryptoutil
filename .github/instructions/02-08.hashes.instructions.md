# Hash Registry and Password Hashing Instructions - MANDATORY

**This file contains ONLY tactical implementation patterns**

## Quick Reference: Registry Selection

- **PBKDF2**: Low-entropy inputs (<128 bits) - PII, passwords
- **HKDF**: High-entropy inputs (≥128 bits) - API keys, config blobs

## Pepper Requirements - MANDATORY

All inputs must be peppered before input into hash functions. See `https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#peppering` for details.

## Hash Service Architecture - MANDATORY

### Version-Based Policy Framework

**Versions are tuple of 5 things: Four Registries based on NIST || OWASP Policy Revisions, and a Unique Pepper**: Each version represents a specific security policy snapshot.

**Supported Versions**:

- **v1**: 2020 NIST guidelines
- **v2**: 2023 NIST guidelines
- **v3**: 2025 OWASP recommendations

**Supports Registries**:

- LowEntropyDeterministicHashRegistry
- LowEntropyRandomHashRegistry
- HighEntropyDeterministicHashRegistry
- HighEntropyRandomHashRegistry

**New Version Requirements**:

If a new policy is published by NIST || OWASP, the version must be incremented to differentiate it from previous versions.

If a new pepper is needed (e.g. 1 year rotation policy, old pepper compromised), the version must be incremented to differentiate it from previous pepper, even if NIST || OWASP policy remains unchanged.

### Hash Output Format - MANDATORY

```
{version}:{algorithm}:{iterations}:base64(randomSalt):base64(hash)
```

**Examples**:

```
{1}:PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256:rounds=600000:abcd1234...
{2}:PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA384:rounds=600000:efgh5678...
{3}:HKDF-SHA512:info=api-key,salt=xyz:ijkl9012...
```

### Version Update Pattern

**Trigger**: Manual operator decision (update config, restart service)

```yaml
# config.yaml
hash_service:
  password_registry:
    current_version: 4  # New passwords use v4
    # Old v3, v2, v1 passwords still verified correctly; rehashed with v4 and updated in DB
```

**Migration Strategy**:

- Old hashes stay on original version (v1, v2, etc.)
- New hashes use current_version
- Gradual migration (no forced re-hash); rehash next time the cleartext value is presented (e.g. username/password authentication)
- Version prefix enables correct verification

### Backward Compatibility - MANDATORY

**Reject Unprefixed Hashes**: Force re-hash on next authentication

## Salt & Pepper Requirements

**Salt**: ALWAYS public (OK to encode in hash output)
**Pepper**: ALWAYS secret (Docker/K8s secrets, config file, env var | NEVER in DB/source)
**Pepper Storage**: MUST be separate from hashes | MUST be version-specific
**Pepper Rotation**: Lazy migration (version bump + re-hash on next authentication, NEVER bulk re-hash)

## Registry Implementations

**LowEntropyDeterministic** (PII): `PBKDF2(input||pepper, fixedSalt, HIGH_iter, 256)`
**LowEntropyRandom** (Passwords): `PBKDF2(password||pepper, randomSalt, OWASP_iter, 256)`
**HighEntropyDeterministic** (Configs): `HKDF-Extract+Expand(input||pepper, fixedSalt, info, 256)`
**HighEntropyRandom** (API Keys): `HKDF-Extract+Expand(key||pepper, randomSalt, info, 256)`

## Overview

Use PBKDF2 for low-entropy inputs like PII (e.g. username, email, IP address) and secrets (e.g. passwords).

Use HKDF for high-entropy inputs like blobs (e.g. secret configuration) and secrets (e.g. API keys).

**Entropy Thresholds**: Low-entropy: Anything below 128-bits. High-entropy: Anything with 128-bits or higher. Practical Definition: 128-bits entropy means input MUST have 256-bit+ search space to brute force (entropy bit count is half search space).

## Pepper Requirements - MANDATORY

**MANDATORY: All inputs must be peppered before input into hash functions**

**Reference**: OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet - <https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#peppering>

**Pepper Storage Rules**: NEVER store pepper in DB or source code. VALID OPTIONS IN ORDER: (1) Docker/Kubernetes Secret, (2) Configuration file, (3) Environment variable. MUST be mutually exclusive from hashed values storage (pepper in secrets/config, hashes in DB). MUST be associated with hash version (different pepper per version).

**Pepper Rotation**: Pepper CANNOT be rotated silently (requires re-hash all records). Changing pepper REQUIRES version bump, even if no other hash parameters changed. Example: v3 pepper compromised → bump to v4 with new pepper, re-hash all v3 records.

## Hash Service Architecture - MANDATORY

**Version-Based Policy Framework**: Versions are tuple of 5 things: Four Registries based on NIST || OWASP Policy Revisions, and a Unique Pepper. Each version represents specific security policy snapshot.

**Supported Versions**: v1 (2020 NIST guidelines), v2 (2023 NIST guidelines), v3 (2025 OWASP recommendations)

**Supported Registries**: LowEntropyDeterministicHashRegistry, LowEntropyRandomHashRegistry, HighEntropyDeterministicHashRegistry, HighEntropyRandomHashRegistry

**New Version Requirements**: If new policy published by NIST || OWASP, version must be incremented. If new pepper needed (e.g. 1 year rotation policy, old pepper compromised), version must be incremented, even if NIST || OWASP policy remains unchanged.

**Hash Output Format**:

```
{version}:{algorithm}:{iterations}:base64(randomSalt):base64(hash)
```

**Examples**: `{1}:PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256:rounds=600000:abcd1234...`, `{2}:PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA384:rounds=600000:efgh5678...`, `{3}:HKDF-SHA512:info=api-key,salt=xyz:ijkl9012...`

**Version Update Pattern** (trigger: manual operator decision, update config, restart service):

```yaml
hash_service:
  password_registry:
    current_version: 4  # New passwords use v4
    # Old v3, v2, v1 passwords still verified correctly; rehashed with v4
```

**Migration Strategy**: Old hashes stay on original version (v1, v2, etc.), new hashes use current_version, gradual migration (no forced re-hash), rehash next time cleartext value presented (e.g. username/password authentication), version prefix enables correct verification.

**Backward Compatibility**: Reject unprefixed hashes (force re-hash on next authentication).

## Salt Requirements (ALL 4 Registries)

OWASP recommends to always assume salt is public. Encoding deterministic salt in hash parameters is OK, because secret pepper protects input from brute force attack vectors.

## Additional Protections for LowEntropyDeterministicHashRegistry

**MANDATORY** (prevents oracle attacks on deterministic hashing): Query rate limits (prevent brute-force enumeration), abuse detection (detect suspicious query patterns), audit logs (track all hash queries for forensics), strict access control (limit who can query hashes)

**RECOMMENDED**: Apply same protections to all 4 registries for consistency

## Hash Registry Implementations

**LowEntropyDeterministicHashRegistry (PII Lookup)**: `hash = PBKDF2(input || pepper, fixedSalt, HIGH_iterations, 256)`. Use Cases: Username lookup, email deduplication, IP address allowlist/blocklist.

**HighEntropyDeterministicHashRegistry (Config Blob Hash)**: `PRK = HKDF-Extract(fixedSalt, input || pepper); hash = HKDF-Expand(PRK, "config-blob-hash", 256)`. Use Cases: Configuration blob integrity checks, secret configuration deduplication.

**LowEntropyRandomHashRegistry (Password Hashing)**: `hash = PBKDF2(password || pepper, randomSalt, OWASP_MIN_iterations, 256)`. Use Cases: User password storage, client secret storage.

**HighEntropyRandomHashRegistry (API Key Hashing)**: `PRK = HKDF-Extract(randomSalt, apiKey || pepper); hash = HKDF-Expand(PRK, "api-key-hash", 256)`. Use Cases: API key storage, bearer token storage, OAuth client secrets.

## Key Takeaways

1. Entropy-Based Selection: PBKDF2 for low-entropy (<128 bits), HKDF for high-entropy (≥128 bits)
2. Version-Based Policies: Each version = NIST/OWASP policy + unique pepper
3. Pepper MANDATORY: All registries use pepper (Docker/K8s secret preferred)
4. Salt Public: OWASP assumes salt is public, pepper provides protection
5. Gradual Migration: Version prefix enables backward compatibility, gradual rehashing
6. Oracle Attack Protection: Rate limits, abuse detection, audit logs for deterministic registries
7. Hash Output Format: `{version}:{algorithm}:{iterations}:base64(salt):base64(hash)`
