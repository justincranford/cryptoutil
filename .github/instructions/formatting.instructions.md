# File Formatting Instructions

- Always use UTF-8 without BOM for all text files.
- Never use UTF-8 with BOM, UTF-16 (with or without BOM), or UTF-32 (with or without BOM).
- Ensure consistent line endings (LF) in all files.
- Use spaces for indentation (4 spaces per level for Go code).
- Maintain proper file structure according to Go project conventions.
