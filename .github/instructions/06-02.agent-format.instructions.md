# Agent Format - Tactical Guidance

## YAML Frontmatter - MANDATORY

All agent files MUST include YAML frontmatter between `---` delimiters.

### Required Fields

- **name** (kebab-case): Unique agent identifier
- **description** (one-line): Brief agent purpose

### Optional Fields

- **tools** (array): Available tools
- **handoffs** (array): Links to other agents
- **argument-hint** (string): Expected arguments

## Agent Isolation Principle - CRITICAL

**Agents do NOT inherit copilot instructions**

When `/agent-name` invoked:
- Loads `.github/agents/agent-name.agent.md`
- Does NOT load `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Does NOT load `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`

**Implication**: Agents MUST be self-contained.

## Continuous Execution Agents

**MUST include**:
1. "AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION MODE" section
2. "Maximum Quality Strategy - MANDATORY"
3. "Prohibited Stop Behaviors - ALL FORBIDDEN"
4. "Continuous Execution Rule - MANDATORY"

## Planning-Based Agents - Phase 0 Research Pattern

Phase 0 is **internal research work**, NOT output documentation:

1. Agent performs research/discovery BEFORE creating output files
2. Phase 0 findings feed INTO Phases 1-N
3. Phase 0 is never written to output plan.md/tasks.md as a numbered phase

**Workflow**: User Input -> Phase 0 Research (internal) -> plan.md/tasks.md (Phases 1-N) -> User sees clean plan
