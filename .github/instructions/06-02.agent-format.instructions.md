# Agent Format - Tactical Guidance

## YAML Frontmatter - MANDATORY

All agent files MUST include YAML frontmatter between `---` delimiters.

### Required Fields

- **name** (kebab-case): Unique agent identifier
- **description** (one-line): Brief agent purpose

### Optional Fields

- **tools** (array): Available tools
- **handoffs** (array): Links to other agents
- **argument-hint** (string): Expected arguments

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 2.1.1 Agent Architecture](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#211-agent-architecture) for agent file format specifications and frontmatter requirements.

## Agent Isolation Principle - CRITICAL

**Agents do NOT inherit copilot instructions**

When `/agent-name` invoked:
- Loads `.github/agents/agent-name.agent.md`
- Does NOT load `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Does NOT load `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`

**Implication**: Agents MUST be self-contained.

<!-- @source from="docs/ARCHITECTURE.md" as="agent-self-containment" -->
**Agent Self-Containment Checklist** (MANDATORY):
- Agents generating implementation plans MUST reference ARCHITECTURE.md testing (Section 10), quality gates (Section 11), coding standards (Section 13)
- Agents modifying code MUST reference coding standards (Sections 11, 13)
- Agents modifying deployments MUST reference deployment architecture (Section 12)
- ALL agents MUST reference Section 2.5 (Quality Strategy) for coverage and mutation targets
- Agents with ZERO ARCHITECTURE.md references are NON-COMPLIANT and MUST be updated
<!-- @/source -->

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 2.1.1 Agent Architecture](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#211-agent-architecture) for agent isolation principles and self-containment requirements.

## Continuous Execution Agents

**MUST include**:
1. "AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION MODE" section
2. "Maximum Quality Strategy - MANDATORY"
3. "Prohibited Stop Behaviors - ALL FORBIDDEN"
4. "Continuous Execution Rule - MANDATORY"

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 2.4 Implementation Strategy](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#24-implementation-strategy) for continuous execution patterns and autonomous agent requirements.

## Planning-Based Agents - Phase 0 Research Pattern

Phase 0 is **internal research work**, NOT output documentation:

1. Agent performs research/discovery BEFORE creating output files
2. Phase 0 findings feed INTO Phases 1-N
3. Phase 0 is never written to output plan.md/tasks.md as a numbered phase

**Workflow**: User Input -> Phase 0 Research (internal) -> plan.md/tasks.md (Phases 1-N) -> User sees clean plan

See [ARCHITECTURE.md Section 2.1.2 Agent Catalog](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#212-agent-catalog) for planning-based agent patterns and Phase 0 research workflow.
