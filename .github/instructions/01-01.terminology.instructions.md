# Terminology - RFC 2119 Keywords

**Source**: RFC 2119 "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"

**Requirement Keywords** (from .specify/memory/constitution.md Section VIII):

- **MUST** = **REQUIRED** = **MANDATORY** = **SHALL** - Absolute requirement
- **MUST NOT** = **SHALL NOT** - Absolute prohibition
- **SHOULD** = **RECOMMENDED** - Highly desirable (may ignore with justification)
- **SHOULD NOT** = **NOT RECOMMENDED** - Not advisable (may do with justification)
- **MAY** = **OPTIONAL** - Truly optional (implementer decides)

**Emphasis Keywords** (instruction files only):

- **CRITICAL** - Historically regression-prone areas requiring extra attention
- **ALWAYS** / **NEVER** - Emphatic MUST / MUST NOT (no exceptions)

**Usage Guidelines**:

All keywords are semantically equivalent to their RFC 2119 base. Use context to determine if CRITICAL/ALWAYS adds historical emphasis or is synonym for MUST.
