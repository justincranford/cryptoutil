# Terminology - RFC 2119 Keywords

**Source**: RFC 2119 "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"

**Requirement Keywords** (from .specify/memory/constitution.md Section VIII):

- **MUST** = **REQUIRED** = **MANDATORY** = **SHALL** - Absolute requirement
- **MUST NOT** = **SHALL NOT** - Absolute prohibition
- **SHOULD** = **RECOMMENDED** - Highly desirable (may ignore with justification)
- **SHOULD NOT** = **NOT RECOMMENDED** - Not advisable (may do with justification)
- **MAY** = **OPTIONAL** - Truly optional (implementer decides)

**Emphasis Keywords** (instruction files only):

- **CRITICAL** - Historically regression-prone areas requiring extra attention
- **ALWAYS** / **NEVER** - Emphatic MUST / MUST NOT (no exceptions)

**Usage Guidelines**:

All keywords are semantically equivalent to their RFC 2119 base. Use context to determine if CRITICAL/ALWAYS adds historical emphasis or is synonym for MUST.

## Abbreviation Standards - MANDATORY

**CRITICAL: NEVER use ambiguous `auth` abbreviation - ALWAYS use specific abbreviations**

**Authentication & Authorization Abbreviations**:

- **authn** = Authentication (who you are - identity verification)
- **authz** = Authorization (what you can do - permission checking)
- **authnz** = Combined Authentication AND Authorization (use when both are involved)
- **BANNED: `auth`** = Ambiguous - could mean authentication, authorization, or both

**Other Common Auth* Abbreviations**:

- **authc** = Authentication Context (SAML/OIDC context objects)
- **author** = Author/Authorship (NOT authentication)

**Usage Examples**:

- ✅ CORRECT: `authn-factors.md`, `authz-policies.md`, `authnz-middleware.go`
- ❌ WRONG: `auth-factors.md`, `auth.go`, `authentication.md` (too verbose)

**Rationale**: Prevents confusion between authentication (identity) and authorization (permissions) in filenames, variable names, and documentation.
