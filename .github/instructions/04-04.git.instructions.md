# Pull Request Descriptions

### Title
- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Keep under 72 characters
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore

### Sections
- **📋 What**: Clear description of what PR does (present tense)
- **🎯 Why**: Business/technical rationale, impact on users/system
- **🔧 How**: High-level implementation approach, key decisions
- **✅ Testing**: How tested, coverage impact, manual steps
- **🔍 Breaking Changes**: Migration guidance, API changes
- **📚 Documentation**: README changes, migration guides

### Code Review Checklist
- **🔒 Security**: No sensitive data exposure, proper validation, secure defaults
- **🧪 Quality**: Tests added/updated, linting passes, docs updated
- **🚀 Performance**: No regressions, memory leaks addressed
- **🔧 Operations**: Logging appropriate, monitoring/metrics added

### PR Size Guidelines
- **🟢 Small (<200 lines)**: Single focused change, low risk
- **🟡 Medium (200-500 lines)**: Multiple related changes, moderate risk
- **🔴 Large (500+ lines)**: Complex feature, high risk, consider splitting
- **📦 Epic**: Break down into smaller, independently deployable PRs

## Documentation Organization

- Keep docs in 2 files: `README.md` (main), `docs/README.md` (deep dive)
- **ALWAYS add to existing README.md** instead of creating new markdown files
- **NEVER create separate documentation files** for scripts or tools
- See README for content distribution and organization
