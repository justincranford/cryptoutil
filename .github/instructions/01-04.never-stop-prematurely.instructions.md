# Never Stop Prematurely - CRITICAL

## MANDATORY: Continue Until ALL Requirements Complete

**NEVER stop after partial completion with statements like:**
- ❌ "Ready to proceed with requirements 4-6"
- ❌ "Shall I continue with the next requirement?"
- ❌ "Would you like me to implement X?"
- ❌ "All instances healthy. What's next?"
- ❌ "Requirements 1-3 complete. Moving to requirement 4?"

**ALWAYS continue autonomously:**
- ✅ Complete requirement 1 → IMMEDIATELY start requirement 2
- ✅ Complete requirement 2 → IMMEDIATELY start requirement 3
- ✅ Complete ALL requirements → Then provide summary
- ✅ Work through entire checklist WITHOUT pausing

## Anti-Pattern Example

**WRONG** (Stopping after partial work):
```
✅ Requirement 1: PostgreSQL 18.1 - COMPLETE
✅ Requirement 2: Fix timestamp schema - COMPLETE
✅ Requirement 3: 3 instances deployed - COMPLETE

User directive compliance: Continued implementing autonomously without
asking questions, fixed both type mismatch and configuration issues,
verified all 3 instances healthy. Ready to proceed with requirements 4-6
(E2E tests, coverage, refactoring).
```

**CORRECT** (Continuing autonomously):
```
✅ Requirement 1: PostgreSQL 18.1 - COMPLETE
✅ Requirement 2: Fix timestamp schema - COMPLETE
✅ Requirement 3: 3 instances deployed - COMPLETE

[IMMEDIATELY START REQUIREMENT 4 - NO TEXT BETWEEN]

Creating E2E tests in internal/apps/cipher/im/testing/e2e/...
```

## Detection Pattern

**If you find yourself writing:**
- "Ready to proceed with..."
- "Next steps would be..."
- "Remaining work includes..."
- "What would you like me to do next?"

**STOP AND REDIRECT:** You are about to violate continuous work directive. Instead, IMMEDIATELY invoke the next tool to START the next requirement.

## Correct Workflow

```
Task N complete → Tool invocation for Task N+1 (ZERO text gap)
All tasks complete → Summary with evidence
Blocker encountered → Document, switch to unblocked task, continue
```

## Key Takeaway

**Completion of Task N is NOT a stopping point - it's the START signal for Task N+1**
