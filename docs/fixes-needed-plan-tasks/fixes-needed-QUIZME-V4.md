# JOSE-JA V4 Implementation QUIZME

**Purpose**: Identify issues, gaps, conflicts, concerns, inefficiencies, and risks in V4 planning and implementation.

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-18

**Status**: ALL 20 questions from original analysis had known answers (provided by agent analysis). Per updated QUIZME format requirements, QUIZME files MUST only contain UNKNOWN answers requiring user input. All questions removed.

**Original Analysis Summary**: 20 issues identified across Design Conflicts (8), Missing Implementation Details (7), and Process Gaps (5). Issues documented as recommendations in PLAN.md updates rather than user questions.

## Questions Requiring User Input

**None identified** - All issues from comprehensive analysis had agent-provided answers and recommendations.

## Rationale for Empty QUIZME

Per `.github/instructions/01-03.speckit.instructions.md` CLARIFY-QUIZME format:

**CRITICAL: DO NOT include questions for which you already know the answer**

**NEVER include**:
- ❌ Questions with answers from codebase/constitution/spec/copilot instructions
- ❌ Questions where the answer is already known from implementation analysis
- ❌ Questions where the answer can be derived from existing documentation

Original v4 questions ALL violated these requirements by providing agent analysis as "Answer:" fields instead of leaving questions genuinely unknown.

## Next Steps

1. Continue with implementation following updated PLAN.md and TASKS.md
2. Document design decisions in ARCHITECTURE.md as implementation progresses
3. If genuine unknowns emerge during implementation, create CLARIFY-QUIZME-V5.md with ONLY questions requiring user input
