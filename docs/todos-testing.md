## 🟡 MEDIUM - Testing Infrastructure Improvements

### Task T3: Optimize Test Parallelization Strategy
- **Description**: Fine-tune test parallelization for optimal CI performance
- **Current State**: Basic `-p=2` parallelization, but may not be optimal for all packages
- **Action Items**:
  - Balance test load across CI runners
  - Monitor and adjust based on CI performance metrics
- **Files**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, test execution analysis
- **Expected Outcome**: Faster CI execution with better resource utilization
- **Priority**: Medium - CI performance optimization
- **Dependencies**: Task T1/T2 completion

```

### Implementation Priority Recommendations

1. **High Priority**: External unit tests (`*_test.go`) - Establish API contracts
2. **Medium Priority**: Internal unit tests (`*_internal_test.go`) - Cover complex internals
3. **Medium Priority**: Integration tests (`*_integration_test.go`) - Validate real dependencies
4. **Low Priority**: Benchmarks (`*_bench_test.go`) - Performance optimization
5. **Low Priority**: Fuzz tests (`*_fuzz_test.go`) - Advanced property testing
6. **Optional**: E2E tests (`e2e/`) - Full system validation

### Current Project Assessment

- **Existing**: Mix of internal/external test patterns
- **testpackage linter**: Currently configured to allow internal testing
- **Recommendation**: Gradually migrate toward external testing for better API design
