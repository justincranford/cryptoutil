  chronological_review: |
    [Chronological Review: The conversation began with a deep analysis request for the cryptoutil project, including copilot instructions, creating a new GitHub workflow for load testing with Gatling, reviewing documentation, cleaning up TODOs, evaluating pkg exposure, and assessing cmd/internal structures. The agent conducted thorough analysis, created the ci-load.yml workflow, updated supporting files, tested locally, fixed issues, and committed changes. The session concluded with a comprehensive project assessment report.]

    [Progress Assessment: All major tasks completed - deep analysis done, copilot instructions fixed, ci-load.yml created and tested, documentation updated, TODOs reviewed (no cleanup needed as they were well-maintained), pkg evaluation completed (recommend keep empty), cmd/internal structures assessed (excellent, no changes needed).]

  context_validation: |
    [Context Validation: All critical context captured - project is cryptoutil (Go KMS service), current state has 6 workflows (added load testing), comprehensive testing pyramid, excellent architecture, production-ready with security and observability.]

  recent_commands_analysis: |
    [Recent Commands Analysis: Last operations included creating ci-load.yml workflow, updating workflow.go to register load workflow, fixing copilot instructions, updating load testing README, committing changes with conventional commit message. Tool results showed successful file edits, workflow listing verification, and pre-commit hook passing with GitHub Actions version updates.]

summary:
  conversation_overview: |
    1. Conversation Overview:
    - Primary Objectives: Conduct deep analysis of cryptoutil project structure and copilot instructions, fix any references, create new ci-load.yml GitHub workflow with Gatling load testing against 3 cryptoutil services, collect infrastructure telemetry, ensure workflow runs and passes, commit changes, review all docs for clarity/correctness, clean up completed TODOs, evaluate pkg exposure for external reuse, assess cmd/internal structures against Go best practices.
    - Session Context: The conversation involved systematic analysis of a production-ready Go KMS service, identification of issues in copilot instructions, creation and integration of a comprehensive load testing workflow, documentation updates, and evaluation of project architecture decisions.
    - User Intent Evolution: Started with broad project analysis requests, evolved to specific workflow creation and testing, concluded with comprehensive assessment and recommendations for future development.

  technical_foundation: |
    2. Technical Foundation:
    - Core Technology 1: Go 1.25.1 - Primary language with strict version pinning across all CI/CD configs
    - Framework/Library 2: Fiber v2.52.9 - High-performance HTTP web framework for API endpoints
    - Architectural Pattern 3: Layered hexagonal architecture - Clear separation of handler → business logic → repository layers
    - Environment Detail 4: Docker Compose with PostgreSQL/SQLite - Multi-service setup with database backends, OpenTelemetry observability stack (Grafana-OTEL-LGTM), and comprehensive testing infrastructure

  codebase_status: |
    3. Codebase Status:
    - .github/copilot-instructions.md:
    - Purpose: Centralized instructions for VS Code Copilot customization across the project
    - Current State: Updated to include load workflow examples and fix reference inconsistencies
    - Key Code Segments: Contains 30 instruction files with domain-specific guidance, YAML frontmatter with applyTo patterns
    - Dependencies: Referenced by VS Code Copilot for context injection
    - .github/workflows/ci-load.yml:
    - Purpose: Automated load testing workflow with Gatling performance tests and infrastructure monitoring
    - Current State: Newly created with 3 load profiles (quick/standard/stress), real-time metrics collection, artifact uploads
    - Key Code Segments: Docker Compose orchestration, Java/Maven setup, infrastructure monitoring script, service health verification
    - Dependencies: Integrates with existing cryptoutil services, Gatling test suite in test/load/
    - internal/cmd/workflow/workflow.go:
    - Purpose: Local GitHub Actions workflow execution tool
    - Current State: Updated to include load workflow in available workflows map and list function
    - Key Code Segments: WorkflowConfig struct, listWorkflows() function, parseWorkflowNames()
    - Dependencies: Used for local testing of all GitHub workflows
    - test/load/README.md:
    - Purpose: Documentation for Gatling load testing setup and usage
    - Current State: Updated with CI/CD workflow integration details and GitHub Actions examples
    - Key Code Segments: Load profile configurations, CI/CD integration patterns, performance testing guidelines
    - Dependencies: References existing Gatling simulations and project API documentation

  problem_resolution: |
    4. Problem Resolution:
    - Issues Encountered: Copilot instructions referenced non-existent workflows, needed new load testing workflow, documentation lacked CI/CD integration details, workflow runner didn't include load option
    - Solutions Implemented: Fixed copilot instructions with accurate workflow references, created comprehensive ci-load.yml with Gatling integration and infrastructure monitoring, updated workflow.go to register load workflow, enhanced load testing documentation with CI/CD examples
    - Debugging Context: Tested workflow locally with dry-run, verified workflow listing, ran pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality, committed with conventional commit message
    - Lessons Learned: GitHub Actions versions need regular updates (v4→v5), workflow runner requires manual registration of new workflows, documentation should be updated alongside code changes

  continuation_plan: |
    8. Continuation Plan:
    - No immediate continuation tasks required - all user requests completed successfully
    - Future development should focus on planned enhancements from TODO files:
