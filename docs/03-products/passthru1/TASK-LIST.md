### Critical Coverage Gaps (>30% to target)

**KMS (PROTECT - only add tests, don't refactor):**

- handler: 27.8% → 85% (+57.2%) - NEEDS TESTS
- businesslogic: 37.7% → 85% (+47.3%) - NEEDS TESTS
- unsealkeysservice: 49.4% → 85% (+35.6%) - NEEDS TESTS

**Identity (CAN REFACTOR):**

- idp/userauth: 37.1% → 85% (+47.9%) - NEEDS WORK
- idp: 57.9% → 85% (+27.1%) - NEEDS WORK
- issuer: 60.1% → 85% (+24.9%) - NEEDS WORK

## Risk Mitigation

### KMS Risk: Breaking Working Code

- **Mitigation**: Test after every change
- **Mitigation**: Commit frequently
- **Mitigation**: Don't refactor architecture yet

### Identity Risk: Too Much Broken Code

- **Mitigation**: Audit before fixing
- **Mitigation**: Fix one component at a time
- **Mitigation**: May need to rewrite some parts

### Integration Risk: Interface Mismatch

- **Mitigation**: Define interfaces early
- **Mitigation**: Build adapter layer if needed
- **Mitigation**: Keep both demos working independently
