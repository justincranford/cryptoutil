- ✅ **Automated Code Formatting** - Pre-commit hooks with gofumpt and goimports  
- ✅ **Test Coverage Reporting** - Codecov integration with coverage tracking
- ✅ **Dependency Management** - Dependabot for Go, Docker, and GitHub Actions updates

### **Security Infrastructure**  
- ✅ **Multi-Layer Security Scanning** - CodeQL, Gosec, Trivy, Nancy vulnerability detection
- ✅ **Container Security** - Image vulnerability scanning and SBOM generation
- ✅ **Security Policy** - Comprehensive vulnerability disclosure process (.github/SECURITY.md)
- ✅ **Supply Chain Security** - Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation

### **Code Quality Enforcement**
- ✅ **Pre-commit Hooks** - Automatic formatting and quality checks on every commit
- ✅ **Linting Automation** - golangci-lint with comprehensive rules
- ✅ **GitHub Actions** - Formatting verification and build validation

## 🚀 **Current Status: Production-Ready Foundation**
