# DAST TODO List - Active Tasks Only

**Document Status**: Active Remediation Phase  
**Created**: 2025-09-30  
**Updated**: 2025-10-02  
**Purpose**: Actionable task list for remaining DAST workflow improvements

> Maintenance Guideline: If a file/config/feature is removed or a decision makes a task permanently obsolete, DELETE its tasks and references here immediately. Keep only (1) active remediation work, (2) still-relevant observations, (3) forward-looking backlog items. Historical context belongs in commit messages or durable docs, not this actionable list.

## Executive Summary

**CURRENT STATUS** (2025-10-02): âœ… **Core DAST Infrastructure Working**

- âœ… **Nuclei security scanning** - Working correctly, 0 vulnerabilities found
- âœ… **GitHub Actions `act` compatibility** - Fully functional
- âœ… **Security header validation** - Comprehensive implementation validated
- âœ… **OWASP ZAP integration** - Re-enabled and ready for validation

**Next Phase**: Validate complete DAST workflow with all scanners

## Active Tasks

### DAST Workflow Performance Optimization (ðŸŸ  HIGH - TOP PRIORITY)

**Context**: DAST workflow performance optimization completed. Scan profiles now available for balanced speed vs thoroughness.

#### Task O2: Implement Parallel Step Execution (ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM)
- **Description**: Parallelize setup steps that don't depend on each other
- **Context**: Currently all setup steps run sequentially, but some can run in parallel
- **Action Items**:
  - Run directory creation in background (`mkdir -p configs/test & mkdir -p ./dast-reports &`)
  - Parallelize config file creation with other setup tasks
  - Optimize application startup sequence
  - Combine redundant curl connectivity tests
- **Files**: `.github/workflows/dast.yml` (Start application step)
- **Expected Savings**: ~30 seconds per run
- **Implementation**: Background processes and command chaining





### Workflow Optimization (ðŸŸ¢ LOW)





### Documentation Updates (ðŸŸ¢ LOW)

## Priority Execution Order

### NEXT PRIORITY - Additional Performance Optimization (Sprint 1)
1. **Task O2**: Parallel Step Execution (moderate improvement)



### Next (Sprint 3)  
6. Additional workflow enhancements and ZAP re-enablement validation

---

## Quick Reference

### Successful Configuration
- **Nuclei flags**: `-c 24 -rl 200 -timeout 600 -stats -ept tcp,javascript`
- **Act compatibility**: `github.actor == 'nektos/act'` detection working
- **Artifact collection**: Local artifacts saved to `./dast-reports/`

### Next Steps
1. Validate complete DAST workflow with all scanners
2. Implement remaining performance optimizations---

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-04
**Recent completions**: Tasks 1-3 (security header analysis, ZAP Full/API scan re-enablement), Tasks 4-6 (ZAP rules, path filtering, documentation), Task O3 (redundant step removal)
**Completed tasks removed per maintenance guideline**
