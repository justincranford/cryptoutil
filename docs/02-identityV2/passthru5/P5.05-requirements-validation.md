## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Requirements Validation Check (10 minutes)

**Goal**: Run automated requirements check and verify 100% coverage

**Steps**:
1. Run: `go run ./cmd/cicd identity-requirements-check --strict`
2. Capture full output for evidence
3. Verify: Total requirements 65, validated 65 (100.0%)
4. Verify: R04-06 status ✅ IMPLEMENTED with commit references
5. Verify: Zero uncovered CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM requirements
6. Verify: All task groups show 100% coverage

**Expected Output**:
```
Identity Requirements Coverage Report
=====================================
Total Requirements: 65
Validated: 65 (100.0%)
Coverage Target: 85% (EXCEEDED ✅)

By Priority:
- CRITICAL: XX/XX (100.0%) ✅
- HIGH: XX/XX (100.0%) ✅
- MEDIUM: XX/XX (100.0%) ✅
- LOW: XX/XX (100.0%) ✅

By Task:
- R01: 6/6 (100.0%) ✅
- R02: 7/7 (100.0%) ✅
- R03: 5/5 (100.0%) ✅
- R04: 6/6 (100.0%) ✅  ← Includes R04-06
- ...
```

**Exit Criteria**:
- Requirements check passes with 100% coverage
- R04-06 explicitly listed as ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Zero uncovered requirements at any priority level

### Phase 2: Project Status Update (5 minutes)

**Goal**: Update PROJECT-STATUS.md with verified 100% achievement

**Steps**:
1. Run: `go run ./cmd/cicd go-update-project-status`
2. Review generated PROJECT-STATUS.md changes
3. Verify status indicators updated correctly
4. Verify requirements metrics show 100% coverage
5. Verify completion metrics updated

**Expected Changes**:
```markdown
**Current Status**: ✅ PRODUCTION READY (was ⚠️ CONDITIONAL)

**Requirements Coverage**: 100.0% (65/65) ✅ (was 98.5% 64/65)

**Completion Metrics**:
- Requirements validated: 65/65 (100.0%) ✅
- Tasks complete: 14/14 (100.0%) ✅
- Tests passing: XXX/XXX (100.0%) ✅
- Coverage: XX% (target 85%) ✅

**Production Blockers**: NONE ✅ (was 1 - R04-06)
```

**Exit Criteria**:
- PROJECT-STATUS.md updated with 100% metrics
- Status changed from conditional to production ready
- All blockers resolved
- Timestamp and commit hash updated

### Phase 3: Evidence Documentation (10 minutes)

**Goal**: Capture all validation evidence for audit trail

**Steps**:
1. Save requirements check output to evidence file
2. Save project status diff showing before/after
3. Update P5.05 task document with evidence
4. Commit all changes with evidence references

**Evidence to Capture**:
- Full requirements validation command output
- PROJECT-STATUS.md diff (before/after)
- Timestamp of validation run
- Commit hashes for verification

**Exit Criteria**:
- All validation output preserved
- Evidence committed to repository
- P5.05 task document updated with completion evidence

### Phase 4: Validation & Commit (5 minutes)

**Goal**: Verify all changes and commit with proper message

**Steps**:
1. Review all file changes (git diff)
2. Verify requirements check output correct
3. Verify PROJECT-STATUS.md updated correctly
4. Verify P5.05 task document complete
5. Commit with conventional commit format

**Commit Message Template**:
```
chore(identity): achieve 100% requirements coverage verification (P5.05)

- Run identity-requirements-check: 65/65 validated (100.0%) ✅
- Update PROJECT-STATUS.md: ⚠️ CONDITIONAL → ✅ PRODUCTION READY
- Resolve production blockers: 1 → 0 (R04-06 implemented)
- Requirements coverage: 98.5% → 100.0%

Evidence:
- Requirements validation output: <evidence-file>
- PROJECT-STATUS.md diff: <commit-hash>
- R04-06 status: ❌ DEFERRED → ✅ IMPLEMENTED

Achievement: 100% requirements coverage for Identity V2.
Part of P5.05 (Requirements Validation).
```

**Exit Criteria**:
- All changes committed with evidence
- Commit message follows conventional format
- Evidence references included in commit
